## 🎯 **My Specific Recommendations for Your Project**

Based on your current CyberSnoop architecture, here are the **most compatible and high-impact** enhancements:

### **🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 2-4 weeks)**

#### **1. Splunk Integration (Highest ROI)**
```python
# Why: 70% of enterprises use Splunk
# Impact: Instant enterprise adoption
# Effort: Medium (already implemented framework)

# Your implementation ready:
splunk_connector = SplunkConnector(config_manager)
await splunk_connector.send_alert(threat_data)
```

#### **2. API-First Enhancement**
```python
# Why: Modern security tools are API-driven
# Impact: Enables ecosystem partnerships
# Effort: Low (extends existing FastAPI)

# Add to your existing API:
@app.post("/api/enterprise/siem/forward")
@app.get("/api/enterprise/ml/analyze")
@app.get("/api/enterprise/compliance/report")
```

#### **3. Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**
```python
# Why: Catches threats traditional methods miss
# Impact: 40% improvement in detection accuracy
# Effort: Medium (ML framework ready)

# Ready to use:
anomalies = ai_detector.detect_anomalies(packets)
```

### **🚀 SHORT-TERM (1-2 months)**

#### **4. Container Security Monitoring**
- Docker network traffic analysis
- Kubernetes pod communication monitoring
- Container escape detection
- **Market demand:** 83% of workloads are containerized

#### **5. Cloud Integration**
- AWS VPC Flow Logs ingestion
- Azure Network Security Group monitoring
- Multi-cloud visibility dashboard
- **Market demand:** 95% of enterprises use cloud services

### **💰 MONETIZATION STRATEGY**

#### **Tiered Product Approach**
