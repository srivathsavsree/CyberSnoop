# CyberSnoop Day 2 Completion Summary

## üéâ Day 2 Successfully Completed!

### What We Built Today

**Database Integration** üìä
- Complete SQLite database system with proper schema
- Packet storage with full metadata (IP addresses, ports, protocols, timestamps)
- Threat logging with severity levels and additional data
- Efficient querying methods for API integration
- Data retention and cleanup policies

**Enhanced API Server** üåê
- Real data endpoints serving actual network statistics
- WebSocket support for real-time dashboard updates
- Integration with database for live packet/threat data
- Proper error handling and logging throughout
- RESTful endpoints for all major data types

**Comprehensive Logging System** üìù
- Multi-level logging (main, security, network, API)
- File rotation and size management
- JSON-formatted security event logging
- Centralized logging with get_logger() convenience function
- Automatic log directory creation and management

**Enhanced Network Monitor** üîç
- Real network interface detection with netifaces
- Scapy-based packet capture with simulation fallback
- Bandwidth monitoring and connection tracking
- Thread-safe operations and proper error handling
- Enhanced statistics collection

**Desktop Application Integration** üñ•Ô∏è
- Database manager integration in main application
- Enhanced logging throughout the application
- Proper thread management for all components
- Updated API server with full component integration

### Ready for Day 3

With Day 2 complete, we now have:
- ‚úÖ Solid database foundation
- ‚úÖ Real network monitoring capabilities
- ‚úÖ Professional logging system
- ‚úÖ Enhanced API serving real data
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage

**Day 3 will focus on:**
- Advanced threat detection algorithms
- Real-time threat notifications
- Enhanced UI with interface selection
- Performance optimization
- Advanced packet analysis

The application is now functioning as a real network security monitor with persistent data storage and professional logging - a huge step forward from Day 1's basic framework!
